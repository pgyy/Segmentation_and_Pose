## Introduction

Segmentation and pose estimation are among the coolest applications of computer vision. Recent advancements in these domains have brought significant innovation in consumer products, from surveillance to broadcast media, fitness tracking, and precision health and medical care.

This notebook implements an image segmentation algorithm based on U-Net (Ronnenberger et al.) and a pose estimation/keypoint detection algorithm based on the work by Thompson et al.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Keras
- Matplotlib

You can also run on Google Colab. 

## Installation
